Html Tags/Elements:
    Pieces of content(elements) are wrapped around opening and closing html Tags
    <p>Hi jits</p>
    (Note: Void elements just have a single tag no closing Tags
    you could end then with <img /> backslash at the end)

Doctype:
    Each html page starts with a doctype.
    Purpose is to tell browser which html ver we opening

Meta Charset:
    We always have a meta tag with charset encoding of the webpage in the head.
    Element: <meta charset = "UTF-8">

Unordered List (<ul> </ul>):
    creates a list where order doesnt matter (bullets not like a adt)

Anchor elements (<a> </a>):
    Used to create a link in html
    Needs a href for link to go somwhere
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>

    Note - Opening Links in new tab:
        href specifies destination link
        We need a target attribute to specify where linked source will be opened 
        By default is _self, but we can specify _blank for new tab

        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>

        Rel describes relationship between linked document and current page

        The noopener attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. 
        Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk.

        noreferrer attribute ensures user privacy and security. The new page doesnt know where the user came from (hiding the referer)


Absolute Links:
    scheme://domain/path

Relative links:
    links to pages in our own website

How to connect css to html:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Rel means relationship, tells us the relationship is stylesheet and the file is styles.css


Containers <div> </div> kinda like flex box containers that can have more containers within.
Specify in css if you want flex-grow flex shrink etc for containers to grow or shrink as you zoom.
